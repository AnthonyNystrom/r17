PCRE is included as a static library.  It's _not_ automatically compiled
as part of the build process because it relies on a "configure" script.


To build:
cd src/pcre-[version]
./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --disable-cpp --enable-utf8  
make
mv .libs/libpcre.a ../../bin/libpcre-Linux-i686.a

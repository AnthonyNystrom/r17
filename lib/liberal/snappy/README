snappy is included as a static library.  It's _not_ automatically compiled
as part of the build process because it relies on a "configure" script.
I've done lots of modifications to avoid libstdc++ dependencies.

Then to build libsnappy.a:

cd src/snappy-[version]
env 'CPPFLAGS=-DNDEBUG -nostdinc++' ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
make clean
make
mv .libs/libsnappy.a ../../bin/libsnappy-[arch].a

You may need to edit snappy-stubs-public.h after the "make clean" to remove references to std::string.

Also, the unit tests compile will fail because it depends on libstdc++ stuff.

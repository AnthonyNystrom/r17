zlib is included as a static library.  It's _not_ automatically compiled
as part of the build process because it relies on a "configure" script
and because we need to do some modifications on some 32-bit platforms.

On 32-bit Linux & FreeBSD, open adler32.c and remove these functions:

adler32_combine
adler32_combine_
adler32_combine64
adler32_combine64_

These contain a reference to the 64-bit mod operator which g++ looks for in
libstdc++.

Then to build libz.a:
cd src/zlib-[version]
./configure --static
make
mv libz.a ../../bin/libz-[arch].a
